<h1>University Database Project</h1>
<p>Thank you for checking my project out!</p>
<p>This project is based on Java and started as part of the Java class itinerary I had during the school years at UMass Lowell. 
The idea was to create an application that can be used to store and retrive some of the common information used by a university: students, staff, 
available classes and classrooms. The application has a UI created using Java Swing tool. Application UI has a menu, which enables users
to be able to choose an option to add a student or staff member or a class or a classroom. You can also create reports containing information 
about classes, classrooms, students and staff members.</p>
